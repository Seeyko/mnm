# Product Requirements Document: MnM

## Executive Summary

MnM is a Product-First Agile Development Environment (ADE) built in Rust/GPUI that treats **product vision as the center of development**, not code. The core innovation is **Spec Drift Detection** — real-time awareness of when code diverges from specifications, with actionable insights to help teams decide whether to update specs or recenter code.

MnM targets small teams (1-6 people) and product engineers working in agentic, spec-driven development workflows, providing a unified environment where specifications, code, and multi-agent workflows stay connected and aligned.

**MVP Goal:** Deliver a command center for agentic development that eliminates spec drift through intelligent detection, git-driven awareness, and seamless agent orchestration.

## Open Questions & Risks

### OQ1: Product Questions
- **OQ1.1** — How do users discover and evaluate "useful" vs. "noise" drift alerts? (requires user testing)
- **OQ1.2** — What's the right frequency for spec change awareness notifications? (on every fetch vs. daily digest)
- **OQ1.3** — Should drift detection run automatically on every agent completion, or on-demand only?

### OQ2: Technical Questions
- **OQ2.1** — Can Claude API handle drift detection at scale (e.g., 5000 LOC file)? Fallback strategy?
- **OQ2.2** — How to prevent AI hallucination in drift insights? Validation layer needed?
- **OQ2.3** — What's the performance impact of running 10 concurrent Claude Code agents?

### OQ3: UX Questions
- **OQ3.1** — What's the optimal dashboard layout for 10 concurrent agents? (needs prototype testing)
- **OQ3.2** — How to visualize dependency graph for multi-agent work without overwhelming users?
- **OQ3.3** — Should spec-to-code navigation be bidirectional in MVP, or code → spec only?

### R1: Technical Risks
- **R1.1** — GPUI 0.2.2 stability — mitigate by early prototyping and fallback to 0.1.x if needed
- **R1.2** — Claude API rate limits — mitigate by local caching and batching drift detection
- **R1.3** — Git repository size limits — mitigate by shallow clone support and file filtering

### R2: Market Risks
- **R2.1** — Agentic development adoption slower than expected — mitigate by validating with early users before full build
- **R2.2** — Competitors (Kiro, etc.) move faster — mitigate by focusing on unique differentiators (multi-agent orchestration, product vision layer)

### R3: Execution Risks
- **R3.1** — Team capacity (3 people) insufficient for MVP scope — mitigate by ruthless prioritization and scope cuts
- **R3.2** — Rust/GPUI learning curve steeper than expected — mitigate by early prototyping and community support

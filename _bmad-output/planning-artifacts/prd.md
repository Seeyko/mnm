# Product Requirements Document: MnM v2.0

## Executive Summary

MnM is a Product-First Agile Development Environment (ADE) built as a web application (Next.js) that treats **product vision as the center of development**, not code.

### Problem Statement

Modern development has a growing alignment crisis at three levels:

**Level 1 — Code vs. Spec Drift:** In agentic development, specs are mission-critical. Yet during development flow, engineers discover better ideas, drift from specifications, and nobody helps them recenter. Products don't match specs, and teams can't identify where alignment broke.

**Level 2 — Spec vs. Spec Pollution:** Drift starts in specs themselves. A Product Brief specifies "SSE," a story writer mentions "websocket," an AI agent follows the polluted context. Nobody catches the inconsistency at the spec layer, and it cascades into code.

**Level 3 — Workflow Opacity:** Teams running agentic workflows have no structured way to define, visualize, or modify their pipelines. Workflows are implicit knowledge, raw configs, or ad-hoc conversations. No visibility into how steps impact each other.

### Three Pillars

1. **Workflow Editor** — Chat-first workflow definition and visual pipeline viewer. The heart of MnM.
2. **Cross-Document Drift Detection** — Detect inconsistencies between specification documents before they cascade into code.
3. **Spec-as-Interface** — Specification documents as interactive control surfaces with contextual actions.

### Core Innovation: LLM-Powered Auto-Discovery

MnM acts as an **intelligent wrapper** over existing development tool configurations. When opened in a repository, MnM uses an LLM to discover all specs, agents, workflows, and configurations automatically — then provides a single dashboard to manage everything. Users can transition from CLI-based workflows (BMAD, Claude Code) to managing everything from MnM's visual interface.

**MVP Goal:** Deliver an intelligent command center for agentic development that auto-discovers existing repo configurations via LLM analysis, eliminates spec drift through multi-level detection, and provides visual workflow management — all powered by a configurable LLM provider (Claude API for MVP).

## Product Scope

### In Scope (MVP)

1. LLM-powered auto-discovery of specs, agents, workflows, and tool configurations
2. Dashboard showing real discovered project state (not hardcoded data)
3. Cross-document drift detection (spec-vs-spec inconsistency)
4. Code-vs-spec drift detection (existing, enhanced)
5. Workflow viewer (read-only visual representation of discovered workflows)
6. Spec-as-Interface (interactive document actions)
7. Agent orchestration with real-time status from AI provider state
8. Conversational onboarding (guided first-run setup)
9. Configurable LLM provider settings (Claude API for MVP)
10. E2E test suite validating all features with Playwright

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)

- Chat-first workflow editing (visual builder drag-and-drop)
- Multi-framework agent support (Cursor, Aider, Codeium)
- MCP connectors (GitHub, Linear, Slack)
- Code editing within MnM
- Real-time multi-user collaboration
- Mobile or desktop native apps
- Enterprise features (RBAC, SSO, audit logs)

## User Journeys

### Persona 1: Alex — The Solopreneur

**Profile:** Solo developer building products with AI agents. Uses Claude Code + BMAD for development. Wears every hat.

**Journey:**
1. Alex clones a repo with BMAD workflows and Claude Code configured
2. Opens MnM → auto-discovery scans the repo via LLM
3. Dashboard shows: 5 BMAD workflows detected, 12 specs indexed, 3 Claude commands found, 2 active sessions
4. Alex browses specs in the interactive viewer → clicks a story → [Launch Agent] action
5. Agent runs → MnM monitors real-time status from Claude Code state files
6. Agent completes → MnM triggers drift detection → "Story S-003 implementation drifted from architecture: REST endpoint uses POST where spec says PUT"
7. Alex reviews drift → accepts and updates the spec inline
8. Cross-doc drift alert: "Story S-007 mentions 'websocket' but Architecture specifies 'SSE'" → Alex corrects the story

**Success:** Alex manages all agentic development from MnM's dashboard instead of running BMAD CLI commands manually.

### Persona 2: Jordan — Product Engineer (Small Team)

**Profile:** Product engineer at early-stage startup. Team of 4 sharing a repo with BMAD and Claude Code.

**Journey:**
1. Jordan clones the team repo → opens MnM
2. Auto-discovery finds: team's BMAD workflow definitions, all planning artifacts, Claude commands, agent configurations
3. Dashboard shows: "3 spec changes since last session" with AI-generated summaries
4. Jordan sees the workflow viewer showing the team's BMAD phases visually: Plan → Architecture → Implementation → Testing
5. Cross-doc drift panel: "PRD was updated yesterday but 4 stories still reference old architecture" → Jordan reviews and updates
6. Jordan launches agents from stories using Spec-as-Interface actions, monitors progress in real-time

**Success:** Jordan uses MnM as single source of truth instead of switching between BMAD CLI, Claude Code terminal, and manual file browsing.

### Persona 3: Gabriel — Team Member Navigating Change

**Profile:** Engineer joining an existing project mid-flight. Needs to understand current state quickly.

**Journey:**
1. Gabriel clones repo → opens MnM for the first time
2. Conversational onboarding: "I see this repo has BMAD configured with 4 workflow phases and 51 stories. Claude Code is installed with 3 custom commands. Would you like me to index everything?"
3. Gabriel confirms → MnM discovers and displays full project state
4. Dashboard shows: which stories are complete, which have drift, which agents are running
5. Gabriel browses the spec hierarchy (Product Brief → PRD → Architecture → Stories) and understands the project structure
6. Gabriel picks up a story, launches an agent, and starts contributing immediately

**Success:** Gabriel is productive within minutes, not hours, because MnM surfaced the full project context automatically.

---

## Assumptions

### A1: User Environment
- **A1.1** — Users have a modern web browser
- **A1.2** — Users have git repository with product specs already committed
- **A1.3** — Users have an LLM API key (Claude API for MVP)

### A2: Workflow Assumptions
- **A2.1** — Specs live in git (not in JIRA, Linear, or Notion)
- **A2.2** — Users follow some structured spec format (BMAD, open-spec, or markdown)
- **A2.3** — Repository may have existing tool configurations (.claude/, _bmad/) that MnM should discover

### A3: Technical Assumptions
- **A3.1** — Claude API provides sufficient context window for drift analysis and discovery
- **A3.2** — LLM classification accuracy is sufficient for auto-discovery (with human review/override)

---

## Open Questions & Risks

### OQ1: Product Questions
- **OQ1.1** — What's the right frequency for cross-doc drift scanning? (on every commit vs. on-demand)
- **OQ1.2** — Should drift detection run automatically on agent completion, or on-demand only?
- **OQ1.3** — How granular should workflow visualization be? (phase-level vs. step-level vs. sub-step-level)

### OQ2: Technical Questions
- **OQ2.1** — What's the optimal LLM prompt strategy for repo discovery? (single comprehensive prompt vs. multi-pass)
- **OQ2.2** — How to handle large repos where full discovery exceeds context window?
- **OQ2.3** — How to mock LLM responses effectively in E2E tests while maintaining realistic behavior?

### R1: Technical Risks
- **R1.1** — LLM discovery accuracy may be inconsistent across different repo structures — mitigate with human review/override and iterative prompt refinement
- **R1.2** — Claude API rate limits may slow discovery — mitigate with caching and incremental updates
- **R1.3** — Cross-document drift detection may produce false positives — mitigate with severity classification and user feedback loop

---

## Next Steps

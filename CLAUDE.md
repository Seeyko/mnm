# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**MnM** is an enterprise B2B supervision cockpit for AI agent orchestration, multi-tenant workforce management, and compliance audit.
Fork of Paperclip, transformed into a multi-tenant B2B platform (pivot mars 2026).
Stack: React 18 + Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM. Monorepo bun workspaces.
Language: French for planning documents.

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER use polling (setInterval, refetchInterval)** — ALL real-time updates MUST use SSE (Server-Sent Events) or WebSocket. The app has a live-events system (`/events/ws`). If data needs to refresh, subscribe to the relevant event channel.
- **Single-tenant** — 1 instance = 1 company. `company_id` is auto-injected, never exposed in UI.
- **Dynamic RBAC** — Roles and permissions are in DB (tables `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`), NOT hardcoded. No `BUSINESS_ROLES`, `AGENT_ROLES`, or `PERMISSION_KEYS` constants.
- **Tag-based isolation** — Tags control visibility. Users only see agents/issues/traces that share at least 1 tag with them. Enforced via `TagScope` middleware.
- **Sandbox** — Each user has a personal Docker container. All agents run via `claude_local` adapter in the user's sandbox. No adapter choice needed.
- **CAO** — Chief Agent Officer (adapter_type="claude_local", metadata.isCAO=true) is auto-created, has all tags, Admin role. Runs in admin's sandbox. Watchdog mode auto-comments on failures. Interactive via @cao mentions.
- **Agent permissions** — Agents inherit permissions from their creator (createdByUserId). An agent in Tom's sandbox has Tom's permissions.
- **Simplified API** — Routes work with or without `/companies/:companyId/` prefix. Middleware rewrites `/api/issues` to `/api/companies/:companyId/issues` automatically.
- **Docker exec** — `runChildProcess` in adapter-utils supports `dockerContainerId` option. When set, commands run via `docker exec` instead of local spawn. Env vars with localhost URLs are rewritten to `host.docker.internal`.

## What's Implemented

- **69 B2B stories** (TECH/RBAC/MU/ORCH/PROJ/OBS/CHAT/CONT/A2A/COMP/DUAL/SSO/DASH/ONB/DRIFT)
- **35 Roles/Tags stories** (all P1 complete, 132/132 SP) — see `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/sprint-planning-roles-tags-2026-03-22.md`
- **Trace Pipeline**: Bronze→Silver→Gold (PIPE-01 to PIPE-07 done, BACKFILL fixed)
- **CAO System**: Auto-creation, watchdog (auto-comments on failures), interactive (@cao mentions)
- **Task Pool**: Pool tab on issues, "Take" self-assign, assigneeTagId support
- **Tag management**: Tag selector in agent creation + edit, tag isolation on all list endpoints

## What Remains

| Item | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **REAL-RUN** | Trace | Lancer un vrai agent run avec tool calls riches pour avoir des traces variées |
| **PIPE-08** | Trace | Workflow-level gold (agréger traces multi-agent) |
| BOARD-RENAME | Tech debt | Rename "board" actor type to "user" across codebase (8 SP) |
| SANDBOX-AUTH | Tech debt | Auto-persist claude credentials across container recreation (3 SP) |
| PRESET-SLUGS | Tech debt | Hardcoded permission slugs in OnboardingWizard → fetch from API (2 SP) |

### Architecture Decisions (Trace Pipeline)

- **Gold** = DEFAULT view. Intelligent timeline, phases scored, annotated, contextualized
- **Silver** = expand for detail. Grouped observations with summaries
- **Bronze** = raw JSON blocks. Debug only.
- Gold is AUTO-GENERATED at trace completion (not manual click)
- Gold prompt is HIERARCHICAL: global → workflow → agent → issue context
- Traces are a MIDDLEWARE on top of all adapters (heartbeat.ts:onLog), NOT inside adapters
- For LLM enrichment: `claude -p --model haiku` which reuses existing Claude Code auth

## Repository Structure

- `server/src/` — Express backend (routes/, services/, middleware/, realtime/, auth/)
- `ui/src/` — React frontend (pages/, components/, hooks/, api/)
- `packages/db/src/` — Drizzle ORM schema, migrations (50+ tables, multi-tenant)
- `packages/shared/` — Shared types (B2B domain models)
- `packages/adapters/` — Agent adapters (claude-local, cursor-local, etc.)
- `e2e/` — Playwright E2E tests (60+ tests in Docker authenticated mode)
- `_bmad/` — BMAD framework. Do NOT modify.
- `_bmad-output/` — Planning artifacts, brainstorming, reviews, stories

## Dev Commands

```bash
bun install         # Install all dependencies
bun run dev         # Start dev (server + ui, embedded postgres)
bun run build       # Build all packages
bun run typecheck   # TypeScript check (13/13 packages pass)
bun run test:e2e    # Run Playwright E2E tests
```

## Docker (Authenticated Mode)

```bash
docker compose build server                    # Rebuild with latest code
docker compose up -d --wait                    # Start server + DB + Redis
# Server on http://127.0.0.1:3100 (authenticated mode, 48 RLS tables)
```
